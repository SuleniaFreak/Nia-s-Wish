My brother says that he is too old to have plushes. #speaker: Nia
But daddy also tells me that it's important for my brother that I take care of Pingu 
while he is at school..... 
I don't understand the adults.
Anyway, I have left him taking a nap in the sun.
So when my brother comes back and hugs him, he'll get a warm hug.
